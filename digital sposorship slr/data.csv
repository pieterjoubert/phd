esports,kramer2021reaping,"Esports  infrastructure  lacks  transparency  and  simplicity  because  the  variety  of  distinct competitions within each discipline and the overlapping activities of organisations involved in the gaming industry impede a comprehensible and logical tournament structure (Funk et al., 2018). The  publishers  represent  a  core  stakeholder  of  the  industry;  through  developing,  designing, distributing and marketing video games, they are the origin of all esports-related content. Some game  developers  (e.g.  Riot  Games  or  Valve)  even  organise  their  own  esports  competitions, produce coverage, and commercialise rights. Furthermore, they license their products and sell these  rights  to  external  tournaments,  leagues,  and  event  organisers,  like  the  Electronic  Sports League, which runcompetitions and therefore act as cornerstones of the tournament system. These companies are fundamentally involved in the competition environment through fostering regulated tournament structures and delivering esports content for broadcasters and media platforms. The REAPING THE DIGITAL DIVIDEND?12broadcasters  (e.g.  Twitch,  Mixer,  ESPN  or  YouTube  Gaming)  buy  media  rights,  stream  live coverage, and display esports events or additional gamingrelated content, often without requiring a subscription fee.Teams and players provide the major reasons why people follow esports –especially for their emotional core, star appeal, and gaming skills. Typical teams consist of multiple squads competing under a unified brand in diverse disciplines from distinct genres. For example, the German team SKGaming has around 30 players in the disciplines League of Legends, FIFA, Hearthstone &Smite, to name a few (SK Gaming, 2019). The key personnel for each team are the players,  since  they  are  pivotal  for  competitive  success  and  the  generation  of  viewershipin streaming sessions. A special form of gamers are influencers, who own a big fan base on their social channels due to their talents at entertaining, in addition to their gaming skill. Sponsors and advertisers are the central drivers of monetisation and hence professionalisation of the scene, since they provide 82 % of the industry’s revenue (Pannekeet, 2019). Advertising companies are often distinguished  by  their  status  as  endemic  or  non-endemic  nature  (Fullerton &Merz,  2008). Technology  companies  (e.g.Intel)  were  considered  non-endemic  for  traditional  sport,  yet  are considered endemic for esports, as they are contributing to the performance of esports athletes, thus presenting an opportunity for technology firms to become naturally associated with gaming and esports, something that was not possible in the past. Fans follow individual players, teams, events  or  games  via  broadcasters  and  are  exposed  to  advertisements  for  merchandise,  online subscriptions, tickets etc. The followers are highly engaged in online settings and take part in dialogues with other stakeholders due to esports’ interactive character. Agencies and start-ups provide specific expertise in various dimensions, such as content creation or data tracking, and therefore  fill  knowledge  gaps  in  organisations.  For  a  deeper  comprehension  and  a  more REAPING THE DIGITAL DIVIDEND?13sophisticated overview, we recommend the Catalyst stakeholder analysis (Catalyst Sport, 2017). Although it may be costly in terms of time and effort to fully comprehend the complex and growing esports ecosystem, prior research in the sport domain has shown that identifying more relevant stakeholders –both nationally and internationally –increases firm performance (Yu et al., 2015). This can only be achieved through a careful screening of the ecosystem",ecosystem,population,roleplayers
